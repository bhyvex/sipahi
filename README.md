SIPAHI is a transparent dns proxy that work as a traffic rate limiter for dns servers

**NOTE**
* Its Transparent in Layer 7
* Works with any DNS resolver
* Meant to protect only DNS from DDOS


##### Getting Started
```
go get github.com/miekg/dns 
go get github.com/pmylund/go-cache
go build sipahi.go 
```
or Just
```
make build
```

##### Useage
```
$ ./sipahi -h

Usage of ./sipahi:
  -6	skip ipv6 record query AAAA
  -cache
    	enable sipahi-cache (default true)
  -debug int
    	debug level 0 1 2
  -expire int
    	default cache expire seconds, -1 means use domain ttl time (default 3600)
  -file string
    	cached file (default "resp_cache.dat")
  -dns ,
    	dns address, use ',' as sep (default "192.168.2.1:53:udp,8.8.8.8:53:udp,8.8.4.4:53:udp,8.8.8.8:53:tcp,8.8.4.4:53:tcp")
  -local string
    	local listen address (default ":53")
  -revalidation int
    	default revalidation period, -1 means never revalidate (default 1800)
  -timeout int
    	read/write timeout (default 200)
  -ttl int
    	default ttl that will be set as validation period (default 1800)
```
Yeah thats a lot of flags, but the best part you dont need to know any for test
Cheers!
```
$ sudo ./sipahi
ready for accept connection on tcp/udp :53 ...
```

##### How Sipahi Works
   
   
###### Understandinh how sipahi verify resolver

Verification of a resolver is required in case the resolver is making request at high rate  
Verification loop can be debugged by disabling the rate limit  

Dig it  
```bash
$ dig @127.0.0.1 google.com

It will returned a CNAME <req_identity>.google.com  
Dig it again
```bash

It got the IP from actual resolved address. Guess what, in the meantime you are
verified. Congrats !  
Dig again for the actual domain  
```bash
dig @127.0.0.1 google.com

Woohoo you are verified and you got the response within a sec 0   
   
Now Wait for 5 min and dig again  
```bash
$ dig @127.0.0.1 google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> @127.0.0.1 google.com
; (1 server found)

You see it took 7ms now. Cause the resp cache in sipahi is expired after the TTL 
period (as of the resp from DNS: 299) but you are still verified, so enjoy !
   
If you wait for 10min your verification cache would be expired too and you would
be forced to be verified again. Be prepared !
   
If you thinking about how to control the verification cache expiration time, find
a flag called `revalidation`. Well its time for you to take a look at the flags
   
   
   

###### Test in real scenario

In a real deployment scenario a host resolve query by an application results in an recursive query to the resolver. The resolver then makes an interrative query to the DNS server and send the resoponse to the client. Sipahi is meant to run in between resolver and DNS server which makes it behave just like another dns server. 
 Â  
In this way for every alias response the resolver autometically run an itterative query to resolve the CNAME  
This can be checked by local resolver by replacing sipahi as a nameserver/DNS. 
   
* Run sipahi
* If you are using mac    
```
1> Goto System Preference -> Network -> Advanced (for the network you using)
2> Goto DNS tab and set your localhost (127.0.0.1) as only dns
```
* If you are using any other linux machine
```
1> Open to edit /etc/resolv.conf
2> Add nameserver as your localhost (127.0.0.1)
   nameserver 127.0.0.1
```
